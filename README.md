# Analysis and Building an Ensembling ML Model for Individuals Smoking Binary Classification Problem-

The objective of this project is to analyse a dataset containing various features related to individuals such
as age, gender, height, weight and other medical tests. and develop ensemble - random forest model
that combines multiple decision trees aiming to accurately predict whether an individual is a smoker or
a non-smoker based on various feature attributes. The trained model is evaluated using the testing
dataset, Common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to
assess the model's performance in classifying smoking behaviour accurately. The model is fine-tuned to
optimize its performance to find the best combinations of hyperparameters that maximize the modelâ€™s
predictive capabilities.
